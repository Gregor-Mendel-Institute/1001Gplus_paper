# Graph deconstruction
- Deconstruct each graph in its bubbles and return a vcf with VG. 
- Later merge all bubbles for each graph (chromosome) and make some statistics with it. 
- Additional software needed: 
  - Python 3+ 
  - [VG](https://github.com/vgteam/vg)
  - [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
